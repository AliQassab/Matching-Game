The game is played by clicking on cards to flip them over. If two cards match, they stay flipped over. If they do not match, they are flipped back over. The game is won when all 8 pairs have been matched. The Reset button shuffles the cards and restarts the game.

### Styling

The game is styled using CSS, including styles for the game container, cards, and the Reset button. The styles include a gradient background, border radius, box shadow, and animation effects. The styles also include media queries for responsive design on different screen sizes.
